Sample Document for RAG Testing

Introduction
This is a sample document created to test the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. The document contains information about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing.

Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI systems can perform tasks such as:
- Pattern recognition
- Decision making
- Problem solving
- Language understanding

Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Key types include:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning  
- Reinforcement learning

Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical and machine learning models.

Vector Databases
Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and search high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are crucial for:
- Similarity search
- Recommendation systems
- Semantic search applications

Conclusion
This document serves as test content for demonstrating the capabilities of a RAG system in processing, storing, and retrieving information to answer user questions.
