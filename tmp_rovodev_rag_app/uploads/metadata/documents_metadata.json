    "text": "Sample Document for RAG Testing\n\nIntroduction\nThis is a sample document created to test the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. The document contains information about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI systems can perform tasks such as:\n- Pattern recognition\n- Decision making\n- Problem solving\n- Language understanding\n\nMachine Learning\nMachine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Key types include:\n- Supervised learning\n- Unsupervised learning  \n- Reinforcement learning\n\nNatural Language Processing\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical and machine learning models.\n\nVector Databases\nVector databases are specialized databases designed to store and search high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are crucial for:\n- Similarity search\n- Recommendation systems\n- Semantic search applications\n\nConclusion\nThis document serves as test content for demonstrating the capabilities of a RAG system in processing, storing, and retrieving information to answer user questions.",

The OS allocates a page for the outer page directory upon process \ncreation. The OS uses demand paging when allocating m emory for the inner page \ntable, i.e., a page of the inner page table is allocated only if it contains at least one \nvalid page table entry.  \nAn active process in this system accesses 2000 unique pages during its execution, \nand none of the pages are swapped out to disk.
